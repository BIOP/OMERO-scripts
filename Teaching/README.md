# Teaching

The scripts are based on simple-omero-client API and are running on Fiji. We use groovy language to interact with OMERO.


# Installation

- Download the latest version of [simple-omero-client-x.x.x.jar](https://github.com/GReD-Clermont/simple-omero-client/releases) 
- Download the `OMERO-java dependencies` .jar file from the [OMERO download page](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/downloads/), under ``ImageJ / Fiji``.

Copy both jars in the `Plugins` folder of Fiji. 

# Data

- For ``Edu-RFP`` example, you can find the dataset on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4248921)
- The ``HeLa-Organelle`` example is the example given in the training. The dataset is available on our public folder (EPFL only).

# Usage

The name of each script is intended to give the general purpose of the script. A full description of what the script does is written in the header of each script.
Step-by-step examples are given and described on our [wiki page](https://wiki-biop.epfl.ch/en/data-management/omero/fiji) for the ``Edu-RFP`` example. The ``HeLa-Organelle`` example is mirrored from the ``Edu-RFP`` example. Thus, you can use the scripts in the same way.
