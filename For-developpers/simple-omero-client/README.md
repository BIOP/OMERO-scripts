# Usage 

Most of the scripts are grouped according to the implemented OMERO feature.
The more complex scripts (mixing different features, using Cellpose/Stardist...) are grouped under ``advanced_scripts`` folder.

The name of each folder / script is intended to give the general purpose of the script. A full description of what the script does is written in the header of each script.
