# simple-omero-client

Most of the scripts are grouped according to the OMERO features. 
The more complex scripts (mixing different features, using Cellpose/Stardist, create project/dataset on OMERO...) are grouped under ``advanced_scripts`` folder.

The name of each script is intended to give the general purpose of the script. A full description of what the script does is written in the header of each script.
